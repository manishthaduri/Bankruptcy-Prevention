# Bankruptcy-Prevention
The project aims to develop a binary classification model to predict business bankruptcy using key risk and financial indicators, with deployment through Streamlit.

**Bankruptcy Prevention
This project is designed to predict whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy using various financial and risk-related features. The prediction model is developed using machine learning and can be deployed via Flask or Streamlit for easy access.

Features:
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Industrial Risk: Levels of risk (low, medium, high).
Management Risk: Levels of management risk (low, medium, high).
Financial Flexibility: Measures of financial flexibility (low, medium, high).
Credibility: Company credibility (low, medium, high).
Competitiveness: Company competitiveness (low, medium, high).
Operating Risk: Levels of operating risk (low, medium, high).
Class: The target variable indicating whether a company went bankrupt or not.
Project Setup
To get started with this project, youâ€™ll need to clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies. The project uses Python and requires certain libraries for data analysis, model building, and deployment.

Running the Application
Once the necessary dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally. The project can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit, depending on your preference. The application will run a local server on your computer, where you can interact with the model.

Model
The project uses machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on its financial and risk-related features.
